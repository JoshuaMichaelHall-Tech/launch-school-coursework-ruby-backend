# RB170: Networking Foundations

## Overview
This course explores HTTP, the protocol that powers the web. Starting with the fundamentals of internet infrastructure, it builds a comprehensive understanding of how networked applications communicate. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid grasp of the HTTP request/response cycle and how it forms the foundation for all web applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the internet's physical and conceptual infrastructure
- Master the details of the HTTP protocol
- Comprehend the request/response cycle and its significance
- Learn about network reliability mechanisms
- Explore security protocols and their implementation
- Develop a mental model of networked application architecture

## Key Concepts
- **Internet Infrastructure**: Network topologies, data transfer, and addressing
- **TCP and UDP Protocols**: Multiplexing, ports, sockets, and reliability
- **HTTP Protocol**: Message structure, methods, status codes, and headers
- **URLs and Resources**: Uniform Resource Locators and their components
- **Security**: TLS/SSL, encryption, authentication, and data integrity

## Major Topics
- **The Internet**: Network infrastructure, physical network characteristics, conceptual models, data transfer, IP addresses and DNS
- **TCP and UDP**: Multiplexing/demultiplexing, ports and sockets, network reliability, protocol characteristics
- **The HTTP Protocol**: Understanding HTTP, URLs, using Telnet for exploration, request/response cycle
- **Security**: Securing applications, TLS encryption, authentication, and integrity
