HTTP is inherently insecure due to its stateless nature and plaintext transmission. Several security risks affect HTTP communications:

1. Packet Sniffing: Intercepting and reading data packets on a network.
	1. Mitigation: Use HTTPS to encrypt all communications.
2. Session Hijacking: Using someone else's session ID to gain unauthorized access.
	1. Mitigation: Use HTTPS, implement secure session management (e.g., regenerating session IDs after login), set appropriate cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure).
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
	1. Mitigation: Implement input validation, output encoding, and Content Security Policy (CSP).
4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Tricking a user into performing unwanted actions on a different site where they're authenticated.
	1. Mitigation: Use anti-CSRF tokens, SameSite cookie attribute.
5. SQL Injection: Inserting malicious SQL code into application queries.
	1. Mitigation: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

Security measures:
1. HTTPS: Encrypts all communications using TLS, preventing Packet Sniffing and tampering.
	1. TLS provides authentication to verify participant identity.
	2. TLS ensures integrity by verifying that messages haven't been altered in transit.
2. Same-Origin Policy: Restricts how a document or script from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.
3. Content Security Policy (CSP): helps prevent XSS and other code injection attacks.
4. Secure Cookie Flags: HttpOnly prevents JavaScript access to cookies, while Secure ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
5. Input Validation and Output Encoding: Help prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
