The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet. It functions as a distributed database that translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

Here is what happens when you type a URL into a browser:

1. The browser checks its own cache for the DNS record to find the corresponding IP address.
2. If not found, it checks the operating system's cache.
3. If still not found, it sends a request to a recursive DNS resolver, usually managed by the internet service provider.
4. The resolver then queries the hierarchical DNS system:
	1. starting with root servers
	2. moving to top-level domain (TLD) servers (like .com, .org)
	3. finishing with the authoritative name servers for the specific domain
5. Each step may involve caching to improve efficiency.
6. Once found, the IP address is returned to the computer and cached for future use.
7. Your browser can then send a request to the web server at that address.

This distributed, hierarchical system allows DNS to be both robust and efficient, handling millions of requests across the internet each day.
