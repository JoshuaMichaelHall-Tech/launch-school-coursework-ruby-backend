The client-server model is the predominant architecture for web interactions. In this model, the user's device (the client, typically a web browser) requests resources from a web server. The server processes these requests and sends back the appropriate responses.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, operating within this client-server model. It defines a standardized way for clients to request resources and for servers to respond.

Key characteristics of HTTP in the client-server model:

1. Request-response pattern: Each HTTP transaction consists of a request from the client and a response from the server.
2. Stateless: HTTP doesn't maintain state between requests. Each request is independent and contains all necessary information.
3. Structure:
	1. HTTP requests include: a request line (method, URL, version), headers, and an optional body.
	2. HTTP responses include: a status line (version, status code, reason phrase), headers, and an optional body.

While HTTP is inherently insecure as it transmits data in plain text, HTTPS (HTTP secure) adds a layer of encryption to protect data in transit.

The client-server model, coupled with HTTP, is well-suited for web interactions due to its simplicity, scalability, and the clear separation of concerns between client and server responsibilities.
