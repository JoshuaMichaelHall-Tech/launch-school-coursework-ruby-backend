GET and POST are two common HTTP methods with distinct purposes and characteristics:

GET:
- Used to request data from a specific resource.
- Data is sent as part of the URL in query parameters.
- Has size limitations due to maximum URL length.
- Should not be used for sensitive data as parameters are visible in the URL.
- Idempotent: repeated requests should have the same effect as a single request.
- Typically used for search queries, retrieving web pages, or API calls that don't modify data.

POST:
- Used to submit data to be processes by the server.
- Data is sent in the request body, not visible in the URL.
- Can handle larger amounts of data compared to GET.
- More secure for sensitive information as data isn't exposed in the URL.
- Not idempotent: repeated requests may result in multiple actions on the server.
- Typically used for submitting forms, uploading files, or making changes to server data.

When to choose:
- Use GET for retrieving data, especially when the request can be cached or bookmarked.
- Use POST when sending sensitive data, large amounts of data, or when the action will cause a change on the server.
