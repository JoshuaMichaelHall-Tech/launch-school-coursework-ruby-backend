The physical layer of the network is the hardware (cables, routers, switches, etc.) that transmits electrical, light, or radio signals carrying network communications.

Latency is a measure of delay in a network. It represents the time it takes to travel from a source to its destination. It is composed of several elements:
1. Propagation delay: time taken for a signal to travel through the medium
2. Transmission delay: time taken to push data to the link
3. Processing delay: time for data to be processed by network devices
4. Queuing delay: time data spends waiting in queues at network devices

Bandwidth measures the capacity of a network. It represents the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps).

Both latency and bandwidth have a significant impact on network performance. High latency causes delays even with high bandwidth, causing slow network response. Low bandwidth limits the amount of data which can be transferred even if latency is low.
