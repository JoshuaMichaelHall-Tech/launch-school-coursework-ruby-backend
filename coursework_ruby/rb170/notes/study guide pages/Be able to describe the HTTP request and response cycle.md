The HTTP request/response cycle is the foundation of communication on the web. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. The client (usually a web browser) prepares a request: 
	1. If the URL contains a domain name, the client first queries DNS to resolve it to an IP address.
2. The client sends an HTTP request to the server: 
	1. This includes a method (e.g., GET, POST), headers, and sometimes a body.
3. The server receives and processes the request: 
	1. It may interact with an application, database, or other services to fulfill the request.
4. The server prepares and sends an HTTP response: 
	1. This includes a status code, headers, and often a body containing the requested resource or an error message.
5. The client receives the response:
	1. It processes the status code and headers.
	2. If the response contains a body, the client processes it (e.g., rendering HTML, running JavaScript).
6. If needed, the client may initialize additional request/response cycles:
	1. For example, to fetch linked resources like images, CSS, or JavaScript files.

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request/response cycle is independent. Servers don't inherently maintain information about a past request. However, techniques like cookies can be used to simulate a stateful experience across multiple cycles.
