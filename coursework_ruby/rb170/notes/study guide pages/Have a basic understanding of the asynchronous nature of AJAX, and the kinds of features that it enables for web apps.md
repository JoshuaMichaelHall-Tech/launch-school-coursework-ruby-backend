AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows web applications to send and receive data from a server asynchronously, without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.

Key aspects of AJAX:
1. Asynchronous nature: AJAX requests are non-blocking, meaning the browser can continue executing other code while waiting for the server's response.
2. Partial page updates: AJAX enables updating specific elements on a page without a full page refresh.
3. Background communication: AJAX requests happen in the background, providing a seamless user experience.

Features enabled by AJAX:
1. Real-time updates: Facebook like counts can be updated instantly, for example.
2. Infinite scrolling: Loading more content as the user scrolls down a page.
3. Autocomplete suggestions: Providing search suggestions as the user types.
4. Form validation: Checking form inputs without submitting the entire form.
5. Lazy loading: Loading content or images only when needed, improving initial page load times.

AJAX works by using JavaScript to send HTTP requests to the server, then processing the response and updating the DOM accordingly, all without a full page reload. This enables more interactive, responsive, and dynamic web applications.
