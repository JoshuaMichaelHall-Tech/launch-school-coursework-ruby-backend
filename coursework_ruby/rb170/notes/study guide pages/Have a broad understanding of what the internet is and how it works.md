##### What is the internet?

The internet is a vast network of networks. It comprises both the physical network infrastructure (devices, routers, switches, cables, etc.) and the protocols (system of rules) that enable communication between these networks. These protocols (such as Internet Protocol) govern how data is exchanged across the internet, allowing diverse devices and networks to communicate effectively.

##### How does the internet work?

The internet uses a system of protocols to format and transmit data. These protocols function at different levels of abstraction, from high level application protocols down to low level protocols that interact with the physical network. They use a process called encapsulation whereby data from higher level protocols is packaged in Protocol Data Units (PDUs) and passed to lower protocols as their payload. This continues down the layers until data reaches the physical layer where it is transmitted as bits over the network infrastructure. For example, HTTP data is encapsulated in a TCP segment, which is then encapsulated in an IP packet, and finally in an ethernet frame. Internet Protocol is required for routing these packets between networks so that data can travel across the internet.
