Lower level protocols, primarily operating at the Data Link (layer 2), and Physical (layer 1) layers, handle the encapsulation of data from higher layers. They add their own headers (and sometimes trailers) to create Protocol Data Units (PDUs) specific to that layer.

For example, at the Data Link layer, ethernet is a common protocol used in Local Area Networks (LANs). It encapsulates data from the Network layer into Ethernet frames. These frames use Media Access Control (MAC) addresses to identify source and destination devices on the local network.

At the Physical layer, protocols define how these frames are converted into signals (electric, light, or radio) to be transmitted over physical media (wires, cables, or wireless connections).

Another important lower level protocol is Internet Protocol (IP), which operates at the Network layer and handles addressing and routing between networks.
