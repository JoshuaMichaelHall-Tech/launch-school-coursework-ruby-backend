# Networking Foundations

## Summary

This course will explore HTTP, the protocol that powers the web. We'll start off by looking at the internet, the infrastructure behind the web, before diving into HTTP in more detail. After this course, you'll have a good understanding of the HTTP request/response cycle and the way in which it forms the basis for networked applications.
