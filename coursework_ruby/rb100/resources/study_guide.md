# RB100: Programming Foundations with Ruby: Basics - Study Guide

## Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Ruby Syntax Fundamentals
- Variables, methods, conditionals, and loops
- Proper syntax for defining and using basic constructs
- Understanding error messages and troubleshooting syntax errors

### 2. Data Types and Structures
- Strings, integers, floats, booleans, nil
- Arrays and hashes for organizing data
- Conversion between different data types
- Choosing appropriate data structures for different tasks

### 3. Variable Scope
- Local variable scope in methods
- Local variable scope in blocks
- Understanding when variables are accessible

### 4. Problem Decomposition
- Using pseudo-code to break down problems
- Creating flowcharts for visualizing program flow
- Translating logic into Ruby code

### 5. Debugging Techniques
- Common Ruby error messages and their meanings
- Using `puts` for debugging
- Methodical approach to fixing errors
- Reading stack traces

### 6. Code Quality
- Using Rubocop as a static code analyzer
- Following Ruby style conventions
- Writing clean, readable code

## Key Concepts in Detail

### Mutating vs. Non-mutating Methods
- Understand which methods change objects in place and which return new objects
- Examples of mutating methods: `Array#<<`, `String#upcase!`
- Examples of non-mutating methods: `String#+`, `Array#+`

### Truthiness
- In Ruby, only `false` and `nil` are falsy, everything else is truthy
- Implications for conditional statements
- Common pitfalls when testing conditions

### Variables as Pointers
- Variables don't contain values, they reference objects in memory
- Understanding object IDs and how they relate to variables
- Implications for assignment and method arguments

### Parameters vs. Arguments
- Parameters are variables in method definitions
- Arguments are the values passed to methods
- Default parameters and their behavior

## Study Advice

1. **Practice Consistently**
   - Code daily to reinforce concepts
   - Work through problems from multiple angles
   - Experiment in IRB (Interactive Ruby)

2. **Focus on Understanding**
   - Prioritize understanding over memorization
   - Be able to explain concepts in your own words
   - Trace through code execution step by step

3. **Build Small Programs**
   - Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity
   - Implement what you learn to solidify understanding
   - Review and refactor your code

4. **Use Available Resources**
   - Ruby documentation
   - Launch School books and exercises
   - Debugging tools and techniques

5. **Test Your Knowledge**
   - Predict outcomes before running code
   - Review the difference between output and return values
   - Challenge yourself with problems that combine multiple concepts
