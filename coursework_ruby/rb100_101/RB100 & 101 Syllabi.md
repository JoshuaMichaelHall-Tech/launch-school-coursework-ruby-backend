# Programming & Back-end Prep

## Summary

The Programming & Back-end Prep course will guide you through everything you need to get started from setting up your development environment to the basics of a programming language (Ruby). You'll work through simple code exercises, and learn about fundamental programming language constructs including variables, methods, loops, iterators, etc. After working through all the various topics, you will be ready to start the real courses and tackle more complex exercises. This course is the pre-requisite to entering the Programming & Back-end phase.

#### Major Topics

- Understand job roles as a backend developer
- How to use a cloud based development environment
- Introduction to the Command Line
- Introduction to git and pushing code to Github.com
- Set up local development environment
- Introduction to Programming and exercises

# Programming Foundations with Ruby: Basics

## Summary

In this course, we'll increase the level of complexity from the Programming Prep course and work on more meaningful exercises. We'll use a static code analyzer and learn to systematically approach a problem using pseudo-code. As we go through these programs, we'll point out important learning concepts like variable scope in methods, blocks, and the main program. After this course, you should have a good grasp of how to write simple programs and think in an imperative, step-by-step, logical fashion. You will also learn to do some basic debugging and trap tricky bugs, and learn to develop a temperament for debugging.

#### Major Topics

- Ruby language and syntax
- When to use certain data structures
- Using Pseudo-code and Flowcharts for problem decomposition and analysis
- Use a static code analyzer
- Learn to debug small programs
- Understand variable scope
- Understand method arguments
