  + Specific topics, snippets, road-blocks, etc.?
  + ice breaker : favorite recent game or a favorite game generally
    - not limited to any 'type';
    - can be video games, board game, card, sport-specific games, etc.
 
> RB119w
  + 1hr. 45mins.
  + understanding && parsing -- detailed explanations of what's happening
  + focus:
    - collections
      - structure
      - behavior
    - iterative mechanisms
      - iteration
      - transformation
      - selection
      - sorting
      - iterator methods
      - blocks

> RB119i
  + **structured** approach to developing a working solution
    - don't have to follow PEDAC by the book (or at all)
    - develop an approach that works for you
    - tweak PEDAC if you see fit
  + process : control && communication
    - 'communication' : higher level thought process / approach, not what you're typing
    - you can pause to think, just be sure to communicate that beforehand and update afterward
  + frontload the process - spend more time on PEDA, esp. PED
    - A is generally a distillation of PED
    - C is generally a translation of A
  + find a way to be comfortable with the discomfort -- it's an indicator
    - process
    - time
  + practicing / studying
    - sugg. : don't worry about time until you feel in control of your process
    - focus on the provided problems
      - practice problems
      - RB119 exercises, esp. Medium && Hard
      - codewars is fine, but not in tune with RB119
      - advent of code is a great challenge
    - practice developing multiple solutions
      - vanilla loops
      - iterators
      - other iterators
    - **don't forget the vanilla loops**
      - anything you can do with an iterator, you can do with a vanilla loop
    - read the signatures
    - don't be afraid to look at others' solutions, especially earlier and later in prep
  + don't memorize solutions; learn to recognize patterns
