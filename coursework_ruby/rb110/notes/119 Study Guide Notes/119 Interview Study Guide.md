- working with simple data structures like arrays and hashes
- how to iterate over an array, string, or a hash's elements, and know exactly how to control the iteration flow. Specifically, understand when to use `break` and `next`
- manipulating arrays and hashes. For example, an exercise might be "reverse an array without using the built-in `Array#reverse` method", or "select the element out of the array if its index is a Fibonacci number," or "write a method that removes every other element from an array"

Problem Solving Process
- Record
- Use PEDAC
- Solve with regular loop, and a second time with `each`, `map`, or `select`
- use both `hash` and `array` when possible
- Use `break` and `next` whenever possible
- Note if I had trouble
- Play with new methods, explore variants
- Look for edge cases
- Refactor Solution and PEDAC
	- Use Regex where possible
	- Ensure names make sense
	- Ensure alg. matches code
- Check Other Solutions and Refactor Again
- Keep List of Methods
	- Function, Return, Mutating, Lexico, description of when to use
- Review Recording - Good and Bad, Area for Work

## Trouble Problems
Ruby Small 
- Easy6 Reverse_Array
- Medium1 Lights
	- How `step` works, `hash#delete`, tried to solve with one method, should have used helpers. Tried to solve without PEDAC. 
- Medium 1 Word to Digit
	- use of hash and regex
- Medium1 Fib Nums Recursion
	- couldn't figure out how the recursion works
- Medium 2 Bubble
	- Trouble with looping, debugging, tried helper
- Debugging 11 Whats Wrong?
	- Issue with debugging sort
