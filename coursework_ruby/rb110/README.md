# RB110: Programming Foundations with Ruby: Intermediate

## Overview
This course deepens understanding of Ruby's data structures and introduces more advanced iterative techniques using blocks. It focuses on refining problem-solving approaches and working with nested data structures.

## Learning Objectives
- Master working with Ruby's core data structures (strings, arrays, hashes)
- Develop proficiency with Ruby's iterative methods and blocks
- Refine systematic problem-solving using the PEDAC approach
- Learn to debug larger programs using tools like `pry`
- Work effectively with nested data structures

## Key Concepts
- **Ruby Collections**: Deep dive into strings, arrays, and hashes
- **Iteration**: Using `#each`, `#map`, `#select`, and `#reduce` effectively
- **Blocks**: Understanding and implementing block functionality
- **PEDAC Process**: Structured approach to problem-solving
- **Nested Collections**: Working with complex, multi-level data structures
- **Debugging**: Using `pry` and other tools to tackle complex issues

## Major Assignments
1. **Small Problems Collection**
   - Purpose: Apply iteration concepts to increasingly complex problems
   - Implementation: Ruby programs focusing on data manipulation
   - Key Takeaways: Improved ability to work with different collection types

2. **Twenty-One Card Game**
   - Purpose: Build a complete card game implementation
   - Implementation: Object-oriented design with game logic and user interface
   - Key Takeaways: Organizing larger programs and managing complex state

3. **Tic Tac Toe**
   - Purpose: Create an interactive game with AI opponent
   - Implementation: Procedural Ruby program with basic AI strategies
   - Key Takeaways: Program organization and algorithm implementation

## Challenges Encountered
- Understanding the subtleties of method chaining with collections
- Debugging complex nested data structures
- Implementing game logic that's both functional and maintainable
- Designing appropriate data structures for different problem domains

## Resources
- [Ruby Documentation on Collections](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Enumerable.html)
- [Launch School's PEDAC Problem Solving Approach](https://medium.com/launch-school/solving-coding-problems-with-pedac-29141331f93f)

## Personal Notes
RB110 significantly improved my ability to work with collections and nested data structures. The structured problem-solving approach (PEDAC) became second nature, allowing me to tackle more complex problems methodically. I found the transition from simple scripts to more complex programs challenging but rewarding.
