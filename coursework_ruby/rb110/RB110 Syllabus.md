# Programming Foundations with Ruby: Intermediate

## Summary

In this course, we'll delve a little deeper into working with data structures such as strings, arrays, and hashes. We'll also learn how to work with blocks, particularly in conjunction with the widely-used iterative methods such as `#each`, `#map`, `#select`, `#reduce`, and others. Finally, we'll fine-tune our problem-solving process and learn to use it by working on more complex program, and get familiar with using debugging tools.

#### Major Topics

- Ruby data structures and when to use them: strings, arrays, and hash tables
- Iteration in Ruby: `#each`, `#map`, `#select`, and more
- Debugging larger programs with `pry`
- The PEDAC process for problem solving
- Nested data structures
- Working with blocks
