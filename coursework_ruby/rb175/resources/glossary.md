**Server**
: Program that accepts and processes HTTP requests

**Application Server**
: Software that executes application code and generates responses

**Web Server**
: Software that handles HTTP requests (e.g., Nginx, Apache)

**WEBrick**
: Simple HTTP server included with Ruby

**Handler**
: Component that processes specific types of requests

**Route**
: Mapping between URL patterns and application code

**View**
: Template for generating dynamic content

**Controller**

: Client-side storage mechanism for maintaining state

**Form**
: User interface element for submitting data to the server

**Redirect**
: HTTP response that directs browser to another URL

**Flash**
: Short-term session storage for messages between requests

**Sanitization**
: Cleaning user input to prevent security issues

**Middleware**
: Software components that intercept and process requests before they reach the application

**Content Type**
: Header specifying the format of request or response data

**REST**
: Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for web APIs

**Sinatra**
