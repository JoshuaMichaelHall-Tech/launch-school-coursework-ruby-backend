# Networked Applications

## Summary

This course will cover server side development from first principles. We'll build on your knowledge of HTTP and the request/response cycle to create a dynamic web application from scratch, before moving on to build some more complex applications using a lightweight development framework. We'll also talk about other development considerations such as deployment and security, and deploy an application to Heroku.
