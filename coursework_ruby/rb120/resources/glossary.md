# RB120: Object-Oriented Programming - Glossary

## OOP Concepts

**Class**
: Blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes and behaviors

**Object**
: Instance of a class with its own state and behaviors

**Instance Variable**
: Variable that exists as long as the object instance exists, prefixed with `@`

**Class Variable**
: Variable shared among all instances of a class, prefixed with `@@`

**Constant**
: Variable whose value should not change, written in ALL_CAPS

**Instance Method**
: Method available to objects of a class

**Class Method**
: Method available to the class itself, defined with `self.method_name`

**Constructor**
: Special method (`initialize`) that runs when a new object is created

**Inheritance**
: Mechanism for code reuse between classes using the `<` operator

**Encapsulation**
: Hiding implementation details and data within objects

**Polymorphism**
: Different objects responding to the same interface in different ways

**Duck Typing**
: Type of polymorphism where an object's suitability is determined by its behavior rather than its class

**Abstraction**
: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential properties

**Method Access Control**
: Using `public`, `private`, and `protected` keywords to restrict method access

**Mixin**
: Using modules with `include` to share behavior among unrelated classes

**Method Lookup Path**
: Order in which Ruby searches for methods in classes and modules

**Collaborator Object**
: Object stored as state within another object, representing relationships

**Self**
: Keyword that refers to the current object or class depending on context

**Method Overriding**
: Redefining a method in a subclass that was inherited from a superclass

**Module**
: Container for methods and constants that can be mixed into classes
