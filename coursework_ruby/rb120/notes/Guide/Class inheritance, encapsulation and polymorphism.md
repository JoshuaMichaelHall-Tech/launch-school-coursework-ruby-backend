# Class Inheritance

### Definition
A class inherits -- that is, acquires -- the behaviors of another class, referred to as the **superclass**. This can occur through module mixins or parent classes.

 **Inheritance** is when a class **inherits** behavior from another class. The class that is inheriting behavior is called the subclass and the class it inherits from is called the superclass.

### Implementation
Typical for is-a relationships
A class can only have 1 parent
