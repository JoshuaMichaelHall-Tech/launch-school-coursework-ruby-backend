Minitest
- Ruby's default testing library (bundled gem)
- Can do everything RSpec can
- Uses Ruby rather than a DSL.
- Minitest comes in two syntax flavors: assertion style and expectation style.

RSpec
- DSL: a domain specific language
- Allows writing code like natural English, but at cost of simplicity.
