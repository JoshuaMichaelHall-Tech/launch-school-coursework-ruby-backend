# RB130: Ruby Foundations: More Topics

## Overview
This course explores advanced Ruby-specific features, particularly focusing on blocks, closures, and testing with Minitest. It builds upon previous Ruby knowledge to deepen understanding of how Ruby's unique features work and can be leveraged in application development.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Ruby's block syntax and concepts
- Understand closures in Ruby (blocks, procs, and lambdas)
- Learn testing fundamentals using Minitest
- Implement custom collection methods using blocks
- Gain experience with Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities

## Key Concepts
- **Blocks**: Understanding block syntax and how blocks work
- **Closures**: Ruby's implementation of closures through blocks, procs, and lambdas
- **Testing**: Using Minitest for unit and integration testing
- **Custom Iterators**: Building custom methods that use blocks
- **Symbol-to-Proc**: Converting symbols to procs for iteration
- **Method Arguments**: Understanding different types of method arguments

## Major Assignments
1. **Custom Collection Methods**
   - Purpose: Implement Ruby's core collection methods from scratch
   - Implementation: Methods like `map`, `select`, `reduce` using blocks
   - Key Takeaways: Deep understanding of how Ruby's collection methods work

2. **Todo List Project**
   - Purpose: Build an object-oriented application with testing
   - Implementation: Todo list manager with comprehensive tests
   - Key Takeaways: Test-driven development and application design

3. **Testing Exercises**
   - Purpose: Practice writing tests for existing code
   - Implementation: Unit tests using different Minitest assertions
   - Key Takeaways: Understanding different types of tests and assertions

## Challenges Encountered
- Grasping the full implications of blocks and closures
- Understanding the subtleties between procs and lambdas
- Learning to think in terms of test-driven development
- Implementing complex iteration patterns with blocks

## Resources
- [Ruby Documentation on Blocks](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Proc.html)
- [Minitest Documentation](https://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/)

## Personal Notes
RB130 revealed the elegant power of Ruby's block implementation and closure system. Learning to write custom iterators helped solidify my understanding of how Ruby's built-in methods work under the hood. The introduction to testing with Minitest shifted my approach to development, encouraging me to think about edge cases and expected behaviors first.
