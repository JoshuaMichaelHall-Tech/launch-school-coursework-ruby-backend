## Learning Path
The Ruby track follows a progressive learning path:
1. Foundation in programming basics and Ruby syntax
2. Object-oriented design and implementation
3. Advanced Ruby features and testing
4. Server-side web development
5. Database integration

## Projects
Throughout the Ruby track, students build increasingly complex applications:
- Command-line utilities
- Object-oriented applications
- Web applications with Sinatra
- Database-backed web applications

## Technical Environment
- Ruby 2.7+
- Sinatra web framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Minitest for testing
- Git for version control
