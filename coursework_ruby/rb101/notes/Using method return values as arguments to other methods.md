When a method is passed as an argument to another method, Ruby first evaluates the return value of the first method and then passes that object as an argument to the second method.

```Ruby
puts 5 + 7 # Ruby first evaluates 5 + 7 and the return value of 12 is passed to the puts method which prints '12' to STDOUT. 
```
