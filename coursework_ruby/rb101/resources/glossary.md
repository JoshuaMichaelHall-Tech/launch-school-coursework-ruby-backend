# RB101: Programming Foundations with Ruby: Basics (Extended) - Glossary

## Ruby Programming Fundamentals

**Method Definition**
: Creation of a method using the `def` keyword

**Method Invocation**
: Calling a method to execute its code

**Parameter**
: Variable in a method definition that receives a value when the method is called

**Argument**
: Value passed to a method when it is called

**Block**
: Anonymous piece of code that can be passed to a method

**Variable Scope**
: Areas of a program where a variable is accessible

**Variable Shadowing**
: When a block parameter has the same name as an outer scope variable, preventing access to the outer variable within the block

**Pass by Reference Value**
: Ruby's approach to passing objects to methods, where methods can modify objects passed to them but reassignment within the method doesn't affect the original variable

**Default Parameter**
: Fallback value for a parameter if no argument is provided

**Explicit Return**
: Using the `return` keyword to exit a method and specify the return value

**Implicit Return**
: A method returns the value of the last evaluated expression by default

**Mutating Method**
: Method that changes the object it's called on or its arguments

**Non-mutating Method**
: Method that returns a new object rather than modifying existing ones

**Truthiness**
: In Ruby, only `false` and `nil` are falsy, everything else (including `0`, `""`, `[]`) is truthy

**Constant**
: Variable whose value should not change, denoted by an initial capital letter
