# RB101: Programming Foundations with Ruby: Basics

## Overview
This course builds on programming preparation by introducing more complex exercises, systematic problem-solving, and fundamental programming concepts. It focuses on developing a logical, step-by-step approach to writing programs in Ruby.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Ruby language syntax and core concepts
- Develop systematic problem-solving using pseudo-code and flowcharts
- Learn to use static code analyzers for code quality
- Understand variable scope in different contexts
- Develop basic debugging skills and techniques
- Build a methodical approach to solving programming problems

## Key Concepts
- **Ruby Syntax**: Variables, methods, conditionals, and loops
- **Data Structures**: When and how to use different data types
- **Variable Scope**: Understanding scope in methods, blocks, and main program
- **Problem Decomposition**: Using pseudo-code and flowcharts for analysis
- **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing common programming errors
- **Code Quality**: Using Rubocop as a static code analyzer

## Major Assignments
1. **Small Problems**
   - Purpose: Practice Ruby fundamentals through targeted exercises
   - Implementation: Command-line programs solving specific problems
   - Key Takeaways: Building comfort with Ruby syntax and problem-solving

2. **Rock Paper Scissors**
   - Purpose: Apply programming concepts in a small, complete program
   - Implementation: Command-line game with user interaction

## Personal Notes
RB101 established my foundation in programming with Ruby. The methodical approach to problem-solving (PEDAC) has been instrumental in tackling increasingly complex exercises. The emphasis on understanding fundamentals rather than rushing through concepts has helped build confidence in my programming abilities.
