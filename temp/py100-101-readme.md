# PY100-101: Programming & Back-end Prep with Python

## Overview
These courses introduce programming fundamentals and Python basics, serving as the foundation for the Python track. PY100 covers development environment setup and language introduction, while PY101 explores more complex concepts and systematic problem-solving approaches.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up a Python development environment
- Master Python syntax and fundamental programming concepts
- Learn systematic problem-solving approaches using pseudo-code and flowcharts
- Develop debugging skills and a methodical approach to coding
- Build simple but complete Python programs
- Understand Python style guidelines and best practices

## Key Concepts
- **Python Basics**: Syntax, data types, variables, operators
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals, loops, iterative patterns
- **Functions**: Defining, calling, arguments, and return values
- **Collections**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking down problems using pseudo-code and flowcharts
- **Static Analysis**: Using tools like Pylint to enforce style
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing errors in Python code
