# Computational Thinking and Problem Solving

## Summary

Programming is a creative process that can be separated into two steps:

- Understand the problem to be solved, and build a mental model that can solve the problem abstractly
- Implement the model and code it in a formal programming language

This course focuses on the first step of the process. The main goal of this course is to help beginners learn to think logically and computationally, and to supply them with a set of problem-solving patterns. We have to choose a language, however, and JavaScript serves as an excellent vehicle to express logical solutions to problems.

This course covers:

- Thinking logically: analyzing the problem and solutions paths, the center and edge cases
- Thinking procedurally and the bottom up, imperative solution expressions
- Thinking abstractly and the top down, declarative solution expressions
- Common problem-solving patterns

The course comes with a rich set of practice problems that focus on training computational thinking skills and using the abstractions provided by JavaScript.
