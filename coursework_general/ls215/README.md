# LS215: Computational Thinking and Problem Solving

## Overview
Programming is a creative process that can be separated into two steps: understanding the problem and building a mental model to solve it abstractly, then implementing the solution in code. This course focuses on the first step of this process, helping students learn to think logically and computationally while providing a set of problem-solving patterns. JavaScript serves as the language for expressing these logical solutions.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop a systematic approach to solving programming problems
- Build strong analytical and logical thinking skills
- Learn to decompose complex problems into manageable components
- Master common algorithmic patterns and abstractions
- Understand both imperative and declarative solution approaches
- Improve code organization and problem-solving efficiency

## Key Concepts
- **Logical Thinking**: Analyzing problems, solution paths, and edge cases
- **Procedural Thinking**: Bottom-up, imperative solution expressions
- **Abstract Thinking**: Top-down, declarative solution expressions
- **Problem-Solving Patterns**: Iteration, filtering, transformation, reduction
- **String Processing**: Pattern matching, validation, manipulation
- **The PEDAC Process**: Problem, Examples, Data structure, Algorithm, Code

## Major Topics
- List processing and functional abstractions
- String and text processing
- Regular expressions and pattern matching
- Algorithmic thinking and problem decomposition
- Systematic problem-solving approaches
