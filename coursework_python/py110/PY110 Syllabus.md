# Programming Foundations with Python: Intermediate

## Summary

In this course, we'll delve a little deeper into working with data structures such as strings, lists, sets, dictionaries, as well as other sequences and collection. We'll also learn how to work with comprehensions, particularly in conjunction with the widely-used list type. Finally, we'll fine-tune our problem-solving process and learn to use it by working on more complex program, and get familiar with using debugging tools.

#### Major Topics

- Python Collections: numbers, strings, ranges, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Iteration in Python: `for`, `while`, and comprehensions
- Iterable Unpacking
- The PEDAC process for problem solving
- Selection and Transformation
- Sorting
- Nested Data Structures
- Debugging with pdb
- Project: Tic Tac Toe
- Project: Twenty-One
