# PY110: Programming Foundations with Python: Intermediate

## Overview
This course deepens understanding of Python data structures and introduces more advanced programming concepts. It focuses on working with collections, using comprehensions, and applying the PEDAC problem-solving process to increasingly complex programs.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Python collections and data structures
- Work effectively with comprehensions and iterators
- Apply the PEDAC process for systematic problem solving
- Handle nested data structures confidently
- Debug complex programs using Python tools
- Implement larger applications with multiple components

## Key Concepts
- **Python Collections**: Working with lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- **Iteration**: Using `for`, `while`, and comprehensions
- **Iterable Unpacking**: Understanding Python's unpacking syntax
- **PEDAC Process**: Structured approach to problem-solving
- **Selection and Transformation**: Data manipulation patterns
- **Sorting**: Custom sorting approaches in Python
- **Debugging**: Using pdb and other debugging techniques
