# Programming & Back-end Prep with Python

## Summary

The Programming & Back-end Prep with Python course will guide you through everything you need to get started from setting up your development environment to the basics of the Python programming language. You'll work through simple code exercises and learn about fundamental programming language constructs including data types, variables, functions, loops, etc. After working through all the assignments, you will be ready to start the real courses and tackle more complex exercises. This course is the pre-requisite to entering the Programming & Back-end phase in the Python track.

# Programming Foundations with Python: Basics

## Summary

In this course, we'll increase the level of complexity from the Programming Prep course and work on more meaningful exercises. We'll use a static code analyzer and learn to systematically approach a problem using pseudo-code. As we go through these programs, we'll point out important learning concepts like variable scope in methods, blocks, and the main program. After this course, you should have a good grasp of how to write simple programs and think in an imperative, step-by-step, logical fashion. You will also learn to do some basic debugging and trap tricky bugs, and learn to develop a temperament for debugging.
