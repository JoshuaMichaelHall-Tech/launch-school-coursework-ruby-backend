# PY120: Object-Oriented Programming with Python

## Overview
This course explores object-oriented programming principles and their implementation in Python. It covers fundamental OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, while providing extensive practice through various OO design exercises and projects.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the core principles of object-oriented programming
- Master Python's implementation of classes and objects
- Work effectively with inheritance and mix-ins
- Apply polymorphism and encapsulation in Python
- Distinguish between class and instance methods/variables
- Debug and read object-oriented code
- Design OO programs using CRC cards and other techniques

## Key Concepts
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and using custom Python types
- **Inheritance**: Leveraging parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism**: Creating flexible interfaces
- **Encapsulation**: Information hiding and interface design
- **Class vs. Instance Methods**: Understanding when to use each
- **Object "Truthiness"**: Understanding Python's truth testing
- **Object Equivalence**: Implementing comparison in custom classes
- **Customizing Operators**: Defining special methods in Python

## Major Assignments
1. **OO Rock Paper Scissors**
   - Purpose: Refactor procedural code into OO design
   - Implementation: Class hierarchy with game logic
   - Key Takeaways: Basic OO design principles

2. **OO Tic Tac Toe**
   - Purpose: Build a complex game using OOP
   - Implementation: Board, player, and game classes with AI logic
   - Key Takeaways: Class relationships and responsibilities

3. **OO Twenty-One**
   - Purpose: Implement a card game using OOP
   - Implementation: Full game with multiple object types
   - Key Takeaways: Managing complex state across objects

4. **Problem Sets**
   - Purpose: Practice OO concepts in isolation
   - Implementation: Targeted exercises on specific OO principles
   - Key Takeaways: Deep understanding of individual OO concepts

## Challenges Encountered
- Shifting from procedural to object-oriented thinking
- Designing appropriate class hierarchies
- Understanding Python's approach to visibility and access control
- Managing object collaborations effectively
- Implementing proper encapsulation without strict privacy
