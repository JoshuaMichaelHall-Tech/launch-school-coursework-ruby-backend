# Object-Oriented Programming with Python

## Summary

Object-oriented programming is at the heart of Python, and in this course we'll work on demystifying OOP and how to code in an OO fashion. We'll cover topics such as inheritance and encapsulation and get at the core of what Python programming is about. You'll be challenged to design and debug several non-trivial OO programs. After this course, you should know: classes and objects, instance variables, class variables, instance methods, class methods, static methods, class inheritance, mix-ins, working with collaborator objects, and many other basic OO concepts.

#### Major Topics

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Mix-ins
- Polymorphism and Encapsulation
- Class vs. instance vs. static methods and variables
- Working with object-oriented code
- Design considerations when working with OOP
- Object "truthiness"
- Object equivalence
- Customizing operators in Python
- Debugging OO code
- Reading OO code
- Working with collaborator objects
- Using CRC cards to guide design
- A variety OO exercises
- Several large OO projects
