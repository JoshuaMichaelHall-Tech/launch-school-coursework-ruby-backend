# More Python Foundations

## Summary

This course will cover some language specific aspects of the Python programming language. We'll specifically look at higher-order and first-class functions, generators, files, advanced argument and parameter usage, closures, decorators, modules, and side effects. We'll also learn how to test our code with the unittest testing library and how to deploy our own packages to PyPI for other programmers to use. This course includes assignments that will build upon knowledge gained from previous courses.

- Iterative Methods
- Files
- Unpacking Iterables
- Closures, Decorators, Callables, and Modules
