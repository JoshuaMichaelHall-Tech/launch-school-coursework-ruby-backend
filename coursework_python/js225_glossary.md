# JS225: Object Oriented JavaScript - Glossary

**Binding**: The association of a function with an execution context.

**Closure**: A function that retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

**Constructor Function**: A function used with the `new` keyword to create and initialize objects.

**Context**: The value of `this` when a function is executed.

**Constructor Property**: A property that references the constructor function that created an object.

**Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and operations on that data within an object, and restricting access to some of the object's components.

**Execution Context**: The environment in which JavaScript code is executed, including variables, functions, and the value of `this`.

**Factory Function**: A function that returns new objects without using the `new` keyword.

**Global Object**: The top-level object in the JavaScript environment (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).

**Hard Binding**: Permanently setting the value of `this` using methods like `bind`.

**Higher-Order Function**: A function that takes functions as parameters or returns functions.

**IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**: A function expression that is executed immediately after it is created.

**Implicit Binding**: When `this` is automatically bound to an object when a method is called on that object.

**Inheritance**: A mechanism where objects or classes can inherit properties and methods from other objects or classes.

**Lexical Scoping**: A scope resolution mechanism where the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code.

**Method**: A function property of an object.

**Mixin**: A way to add methods to objects without using inheritance.

**Mutating Operation**: An operation that changes the state of an object.

**Object Creation Pattern**: Different ways to create and initialize objects (e.g., factory functions, constructor functions, OLOO).

**Object Factory**: A function that creates and returns new objects.

**OLOO (Objects Linking to Other Objects)**: An object creation pattern that uses prototypal delegation directly.

**Partial Function Application**: Creating a new function from an existing function with some of its arguments pre-set.

**Private Data**: Data that is not directly accessible from outside an object or function.

**Prototype**: An object from which other objects inherit properties and methods.

**Prototype Chain**: The series of objects connected through their prototype properties.

**Prototypal Inheritance**: Inheritance mechanism in JavaScript where objects inherit directly from other objects.

**Pseudo-classical Pattern**: An object creation pattern that simulates class-based inheritance using constructor functions and prototypes.

**Static Method/Property**: Methods or properties that belong to a constructor function itself, not its instances.
