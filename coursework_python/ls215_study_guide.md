# LS215: Computational Thinking and Problem Solving - Study Guide

## List Processing and Functional Abstractions

### Key Concepts:

1. **Passing Functions as Arguments**
   - JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens
   - Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
   - This enables powerful abstractions and code reuse

2. **Declarative vs. Imperative Programming**
   - Declarative: focuses on what to do, not how to do it
   - Imperative: focuses on step-by-step instructions
   - Declarative code is often more concise and readable

3. **Common List Processing Patterns**
   - **Iteration**: Processing each element in a collection
   - **Filtering/Selection**: Creating a subset based on criteria
   - **Transformation**: Creating a new collection by changing elements
   - **Reduction**: Combining elements to a single value
   - **Interrogation**: Checking for specific conditions

4. **Combining Abstractions**
   - Chaining multiple operations together
   - Building complex operations from simple ones
   - Understanding execution order when combining methods

### Practice Questions:

1. What's the difference between `map` and `forEach`?
2. How would you filter an array to only include even numbers?
3. Write a function that transforms an array of strings to all uppercase.
4. How would you use `reduce` to calculate the sum of numbers in an array?
5. Chain methods to filter an array for numbers greater than 5, then double each remaining number.

## String and Text Processing

### Key Concepts:

1. **String Methods**
   - Understand common string manipulation methods
   - Know when to use each method for different tasks
   - Be familiar with method return values and behaviors

2. **Regular Expressions**
   - Pattern matching in strings
   - Syntax for different pattern requirements
   - Common regex patterns for validation, extraction, etc.
   - Performance considerations for complex patterns

3. **Common String Processing Tasks**
   - Validation (email, phone numbers, etc.)
   - Extraction of specific information
   - Text analysis (word counts, longest word, etc.)
   - String transformation (capitalization, formatting, etc.)

### Practice Questions:

1. Write a function to validate an email address using regular expressions.
2. How would you count the occurrence of each word in a sentence?
3. Write a function to find the longest word in a string.
4. How would you check if a string has balanced parentheses?
5. Write a function that extracts all numbers from a string.

## General Problem Solving (PEDAC)

### Key Concepts:

1. **Understanding the Problem**
   - Identify inputs, outputs, and edge cases
   - Clarify requirements and constraints
   - Ask questions to resolve ambiguities

2. **Examples/Test Cases**
   - Create examples for normal cases
   - Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Ensure examples cover all requirements

3. **Data Structure**
   - Choose appropriate data structures
   - Consider efficiency and ease of implementation
   - Plan how data will flow through your solution

4. **Algorithm**
   - Break down the problem into steps
   - Be specific but language-agnostic
   - Consider alternative approaches

5. **Code**
   - Implement the algorithm
   - Test against examples
   - Refactor for clarity and efficiency

### Practice Questions:

1. Follow the PEDAC process to solve: Write a function that returns all palindromes in a string.
2. How would you approach comparing version numbers (e.g., "1.2" vs "1.10")?
3. Design an algorithm to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
4. Apply PEDAC to implement a function that checks if a number is a valid credit card number.
5. How would you document your problem-solving process for complex problems?

## Exam Preparation Tips

1. **Practice Problems**
   - Work through a variety of problem types
   - Time yourself to build efficiency
   - Review and refactor your solutions

2. **Understand Functional Abstractions**
   - Be comfortable with higher-order functions
   - Know which abstraction fits different problems
   - Practice combining abstractions efficiently

3. **Master Regular Expressions**
   - Practice writing patterns for common scenarios
   - Understand performance implications
   - Be able to explain regex patterns verbally

4. **Solidify PEDAC Process**
   - Follow the process consistently
   - Document your thinking clearly
   - Focus on building strong algorithmic thinking

5. **Review Edge Cases**
   - Empty inputs, extreme values, invalid inputs
   - Type coercion issues
   - Performance with large inputs
