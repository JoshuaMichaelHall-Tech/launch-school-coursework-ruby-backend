# PY175: Networked Applications with Python - Glossary

## HTTP and Web Fundamentals

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol used for transferring data on the web between clients and servers.

**HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**: An extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption for secure communications.

**Request**: A message sent by a client to a server, asking for information or action.

**Response**: A message sent by a server to a client, in reply to a request.

**URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: A reference to a web resource that specifies its location and a mechanism for retrieving it.

**URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource.

**HTTP Method**: The action to be performed on a resource, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

**Status Code**: A three-digit number returned in an HTTP response indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

**Header**: Additional information included in HTTP requests and responses, provided as key-value pairs.

**Body**: The main content of an HTTP message, which follows the headers.

**Query String**: Part of a URL that assigns values to specified parameters (follows the ? character).

**Path**: The part of a URL that specifies the location of a resource on the server.

**State**: Information about a user's session or interactions with a web application.

**Stateless**: A protocol or application that doesn't maintain state between requests (HTTP is inherently stateless).

**Client**: The program or device that initiates requests to a server (e.g., a web browser).

**Server**: A program or device that receives and responds to client requests.

## WSGI and Web Frameworks

**WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)**: A specification for a standardized interface between web servers and Python web applications.

**Web Framework**: A software framework designed to support the development of web applications.

**Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.

**Jinja2**: A template engine for Python, used by Flask for rendering HTML templates.

**Route**: A mapping between a URL pattern and a function that handles requests to that URL.

**View Function**: A Python function that processes a request and returns a response.

**Blueprint**: A way to organize a Flask application into components.

**Decorator**: In Flask, a function that wraps another function to add functionality, often used for route registration.

**Application Factory**: A pattern for creating Flask applications that allows for better testing and configuration.

**Context**: The environment in which a Flask application runs, containing information about the current request, session, etc.

## Templates and Rendering

**Template**: A file containing a mixture of static content and dynamic placeholders that get replaced with actual values when rendered.

**Template Engine**: Software that processes templates and substitutes variables with actual values.

**Template Inheritance**: A feature that allows templates to extend or include other templates.

**Layout**: A template that defines the common structure shared by multiple pages.

**Block**: A section of a template that can be overridden by child templates.

**Filter**: A function that can transform a value in a template (e.g., converting text to uppercase).

**Macro**: A reusable piece of template code, similar to a function in programming.

**Rendering**: The process of generating HTML by combining a template with data.

**Static File**: A file that doesn't change and is served directly by the web server (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images).

**URL For**: A function that generates URLs for Flask routes, ensuring that URLs are correct even if routes change.

## Sessions and State Management

**Session**: A way to preserve state across multiple HTTP requests for the same user.

**Cookie**: A small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer.

**Session ID**: A unique identifier assigned to a user's session.

**Flash Message**: A temporary message stored in the session to display feedback to the user.

**State Management**: Techniques used to maintain state in web applications despite HTTP's stateless nature.

**Persistence**: The characteristic of data that outlives the process that created it.

**Session Store**: A location where session data is stored (e.g., server memory, file system, database).

**Session Hijacking**: A security attack where an attacker takes over a user's session.

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: An attack that forces authenticated users to submit unwanted requests to a web application.

**CSRF Token**: A unique, secret, unpredictable value generated by the server and included in a form to prevent CSRF attacks.

## Forms and Validation

**Form**: A collection of input elements that allows users to submit data to a web application.

**Validation**: The process of checking if data meets certain criteria before processing it.

**Client-side Validation**: Validation performed in the browser using JavaScript.

**Server-side Validation**: Validation performed on the server after form submission.

**Form Handling**: The process of receiving, validating, and processing form data.

**Sanitization**: The process of cleaning user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Required Field**: A form field that must be filled out before submission.

**Form Submission**: The action of sending form data to a server for processing.

**Redirect After Post**: A pattern where a web application redirects the user after a successful form submission.

**Idempotent**: An operation that produces the same result regardless of how many times it's performed.

## Authentication and Security

**Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user.

**Authorization**: The process of determining if a user has permission to access a resource or perform an action.

**Password Hashing**: The process of transforming a password into an unreadable string to protect it.

**Salt**: Random data added to a password before hashing to prevent dictionary attacks.

**Session Management**: The process of creating, maintaining, and destroying user sessions.

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: A security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

**SQL Injection**: A code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in database queries.

**HTTPS**: The secure version of HTTP, using TLS encryption to protect data in transit.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: A mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain.

**Content Security Policy (CSP)**: A security layer that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks.

## File Operations and CMS

**CMS (Content Management System)**: A system that allows users to create, manage, and modify content on a website.

**File System**: The way files are organized and stored on a computer.

**File Path**: The location of a file in a file system.

**Working Directory**: The directory in which a process is currently operating.

**Absolute Path**: A complete path from the root directory to a file or directory.

**Relative Path**: A path that specifies a file location relative to the current directory.

**MIME Type**: A standard that indicates the nature and format of a file.

**Static File Serving**: The process of delivering static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) to clients.

## Testing Web Applications

**Unit Test**: A test that verifies the behavior of a specific function or method in isolation.

**Integration Test**: A test that verifies interactions between components of a system.

**End-to-End Test**: A test that verifies the entire application from start to finish.

**Test Client**: A tool that simulates HTTP requests to test a web application.

**Fixture**: A known and fixed environment used for running tests consistently.

**Mock**: An object that simulates the behavior of a real object in a controlled way.

**Test Coverage**: A measure of how much of the code is executed during tests.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: A development process where tests are written before the code.
