# PY175: Networked Applications with Python

## Overview
This course covers server-side web development from first principles using Python. It builds on knowledge of HTTP and the request/response cycle to create dynamic web applications, first from scratch and then using the Flask framework. The course also addresses deployment, security, and testing of web applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand HTTP and the request/response cycle in depth
- Build web applications from scratch in Python
- Master the Flask web framework
- Implement session management and state persistence
- Develop secure, tested web applications
- Deploy Python web applications to production environments

## Key Concepts
- **HTTP Protocol**: Methods, headers, status codes, request/response cycle
- **WSGI**: Python's web server gateway interface
- **Flask Framework**: Routing, templates, static files
- **Templates**: Using Jinja2 for dynamic HTML generation
- **Session Management**: Cookies, flash messages, user authentication
- **Form Handling**: Validations, redirections, confirmations
- **Static Files**: Managing CSS, JavaScript, and images
- **Testing**: Testing web applications in Python
