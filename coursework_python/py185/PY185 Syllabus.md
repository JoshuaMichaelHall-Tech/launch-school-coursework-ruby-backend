# Database Applications with Python

## Summary

This course takes the lessons of LS180 and introduces the concept of working with databases from your applications. We'll build a simple command-line application, then move on to a more advanced database-backed Todo application that uses a high-level relational abstraction library. We'll also talk about how to optimize SQL queries from within your applications.

#### Major Topics

- Executing SQL From Python
- The psycopg2 PostgreSQL Adapter
- Handling Parameters Safely
- Code Structure
- Creating Database Schema Automatically
- Session Persistence
- Designing a Schema
- Interacting with a Database from Python
- Deploying PG Applications to Render
- Optimization
