# JS210: Fundamentals of JavaScript for Programmers - Glossary

**Arrow Function**: A concise syntax for writing JavaScript functions using the `=>` notation.

**Callback Function**: A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later.

**Closure**: A function that retains access to variables from its lexical scope, even when executed outside that scope.

**Coercion**: Automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another.

**Data Types**: Categories of values in JavaScript: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, and Object.

**Declaration**: Statement that creates a variable, function, or object without initializing it.

**Expression**: Any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

**First-class Function**: Functions that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

**Function Declaration**: A function defined using the `function` keyword that is hoisted.

**Function Expression**: A function defined and assigned within an expression that is not hoisted.

**Hoisting**: JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.

**Immutability**: The inability of a value to be changed after creation.

**Lexical Scoping**: The scope of a variable is determined by its location within the source code.

**Mutable Value**: A value that can be changed after creation.

**Operator**: Symbols that perform operations on operands (values).

**Primitives**: Basic data types in JavaScript: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, and Symbol.

**Pure Function**: A function that always returns the same result for the same input and has no side effects.

**Reference Value**: Values that are objects (including arrays and functions), stored by reference.

**Scope**: The accessibility or visibility of variables within different parts of a program.

**Side Effect**: Any application state change that is observable outside the called function.

**Statement**: A piece of code that performs an action.

**Strict Mode**: A restricted variant of JavaScript that eliminates some silent errors and prohibits some syntax.

**Type Coercion**: Converting a value from one data type to another, either implicitly or explicitly.

**Temporal Dead Zone**: The period between entering scope and being declared where variables cannot be accessed.

**Variable Shadowing**: When a variable in a local scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope.
