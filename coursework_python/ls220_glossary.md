# LS220: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms - Glossary

**Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

**Anchor/Runner technique**: A pointer-based approach where one pointer (anchor) moves slowly while another (runner) moves faster through a data structure.

**Backtracking**: An algorithmic technique that abandons a path when it's determined not to lead to a solution.

**Big O Notation**: A mathematical notation used to describe the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

**Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm to find an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

**Binary Tree**: A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children.

**Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.

**Data Structure**: A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data.

**Divide and Conquer**: An algorithmic paradigm that solves a problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and combining the solutions.

**Dynamic Programming**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their results to avoid redundant computations.

**Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting these nodes.

**Insertion Sort**: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

**Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each pointing to the next node in the sequence.

**Queue**: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

**Recursion**: A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.

**Selection Sort**: A sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.

**Space Complexity**: The amount of memory space required by an algorithm in relation to the input size.

**Stack**: A collection designed for holding elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access.

**Start/End technique**: A pointer-based approach where pointers are placed at the beginning and end of a data structure, moving toward each other.

**Time Complexity**: The amount of time required by an algorithm to run, as a function of the input size.
