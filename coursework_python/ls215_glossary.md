# LS215: Computational Thinking and Problem Solving - Glossary

**Abstract thinking**: A top-down, declarative approach to problem-solving focusing on what needs to be done rather than how.

**Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling based on the essential properties relevant to the current purpose.

**Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

**Arrow function**: A concise JavaScript syntax for writing anonymous functions (`(param) => expression`).

**Callback function**: A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later.

**Computational thinking**: A problem-solving approach involving breaking down problems and formulating solutions in a way that can be effectively carried out by a computer.

**Declarative programming**: A programming paradigm that expresses the logic of computation without describing its control flow; focuses on what the program should accomplish.

**Edge case**: An input or scenario that's at the extreme range of possible values and might cause problems.

**Filtering/Selection**: The process of creating a new collection containing only elements that meet specified criteria.

**First-class functions**: The treatment of functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

**Function**: A reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.

**Higher-order function**: A function that takes functions as parameters or returns functions.

**Imperative programming**: A programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state; focuses on how a program operates.

**Iteration**: The process of repeatedly executing a block of code.

**List processing**: Techniques for working with collections of data (arrays, etc.).

**PEDAC**: Problem-solving approach: Problem, Examples, Data structure, Algorithm, Code.

**Procedural thinking**: A bottom-up, imperative approach to problem-solving focusing on steps and procedures.

**Reducing/Folding**: The process of combining all elements in a collection to produce a single value.

**Regular expression**: A sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, mainly for string matching.

**String processing**: Techniques for manipulating and working with text.

**Test case**: A set of conditions used to determine if a system or component functions correctly.

**Transformation**: The process of creating a new collection by applying operations to each element of an existing collection.
