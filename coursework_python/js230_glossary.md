# JS230: DOM and Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript - Glossary

**AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: A technique for creating asynchronous web applications, enabling data retrieval from a server without reloading the page.

**Asynchronous Programming**: A programming paradigm where operations can execute independently of the main program flow, allowing code to continue running while waiting for operations to complete.

**Attribute**: Named values that configure HTML elements or provide additional information about them.

**BOM (Browser Object Model)**: A browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser, with `window` as the global object.

**Bubbling**: An event propagation mode where an event first triggers on the target element, then bubbles up through its ancestors.

**Callback Function**: A function passed as an argument to another function, which is executed after the completion of a specific operation.

**Capturing**: An event propagation mode where an event is first captured by the outermost element and then propagated to the inner elements.

**Client-Side Rendering**: Generating HTML using JavaScript within the browser, as opposed to receiving fully-formed HTML from the server.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: A security mechanism that allows or restricts requests to resources on a different domain than the originating site.

**Data Serialization**: The process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted.

**Delegation**: A technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element to handle events triggered by its children.

**Document**: The root node of the HTML document, represented by the `document` object.

**DOM (Document Object Model)**: A programming interface for HTML and XML documents that represents the page as a tree of nodes, allowing programs to change the document structure, style, and content.

**Event**: An action or occurrence that happens in the browser, which can be detected by JavaScript.

**Event Handler**: A function that is executed when a specific event occurs.

**Event Listener**: A function that waits for a specified event to occur on a specific element.

**Event Loop**: A programming construct that waits for and dispatches events in a program.

**Event Object**: An object containing information about an event when it occurs.

**Event Propagation**: The process by which an event travels through the DOM tree.

**Fetch API**: A modern interface for making HTTP requests using JavaScript promises.

**Handlebars**: A JavaScript templating library for creating reusable HTML templates.

**HTML Data Attributes**: Custom attributes that store private data for the page or application.

**HTTP Method**: The action to be performed on a resource, such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.

**jQuery**: A JavaScript library designed to simplify DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX.

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data interchange format based on a subset of JavaScript syntax.

**Node**: A basic unit in the DOM, which can be an element, attribute, text, etc.

**Promise**: An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

**Propagation**: The way an event travels through the DOM tree.

**Selector**: A pattern used to select and manipulate HTML elements.

**Server-Side Rendering**: Generating HTML on the server before sending it to the client.

**setTimeout/setInterval**: Functions that execute code after a specified delay or at specified intervals.

**State**: Information about the current condition of an application or component.

**Template**: A pre-defined structure with placeholders for dynamic content.

**XMLHttpRequest (XHR)**: An API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript.
