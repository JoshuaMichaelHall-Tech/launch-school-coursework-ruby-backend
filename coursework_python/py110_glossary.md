# PY110: Programming Foundations with Python: Intermediate - Glossary

**Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

**Collection**: A container that holds multiple items (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples).

**Comprehension**: A concise way to create a new collection by iterating over an existing collection (e.g., list comprehension, dictionary comprehension).

**Data Structure**: A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data.

**Deep Copy**: A copy of an object where all nested objects are also copied, creating entirely new objects.

**Destructuring/Unpacking**: Extracting individual values from collections and assigning them to variables.

**Dictionary**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python, represented with curly braces `{}`.

**Frozen Set**: An immutable version of a set.

**Generator**: A function that returns an iterator that yields items one at a time, pausing execution between items.

**Iterable**: An object capable of returning its elements one at a time.

**Iteration**: The process of moving through a sequence or collection one element at a time.

**Iterator**: An object representing a stream of data that returns elements one at a time.

**List**: An ordered, mutable collection of elements in Python, represented with square brackets `[]`.

**Mapping**: A collection of key-value pairs where each key maps to a value (dictionaries in Python).

**Mutable**: Objects whose state can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

**Nested Data Structure**: A data structure that contains other data structures as elements.

**pdb**: The Python Debugger, a module that provides an interactive debugging environment.

**PEDAC**: A problem-solving approach: Problem, Examples, Data Structures, Algorithm, Code.

**Range**: A sequence representing an arithmetic progression of integers.

**Selection**: The process of choosing elements from a collection based on certain criteria.

**Sequence**: An ordered collection of items, including strings, lists, and tuples.

**Set**: An unordered collection of unique elements in Python, represented with curly braces `{}`.

**Shallow Copy**: A copy of an object that doesn't copy nested objects, just their references.

**Sorting**: Arranging elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending, descending).

**String**: A sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes.

**Transformation**: The process of converting elements of a collection into a new form.

**Tuple**: An ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python, represented with parentheses `()`.

**Unpacking**: Assigning the elements of an iterable to a set of variables in a single operation.
