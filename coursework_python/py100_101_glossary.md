# PY100-101: Programming & Back-end Prep with Python - Glossary

**Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or accomplish a task.

**Argument**: A value passed to a function during a function call.

**Assignment**: The process of storing a value in a variable.

**Boolean**: A data type with two possible values: `True` or `False`.

**Conditional Statement**: Code that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false (if, elif, else).

**Concatenation**: Joining strings together using the `+` operator.

**Data Type**: A classification of data that tells the interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data (e.g., int, str, bool).

**Debugging**: The process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in code.

**Dictionary**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python, represented with curly braces `{}`.

**Exception**: An error detected during program execution.

**Expression**: A combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value.

**Float**: A data type representing decimal numbers.

**Function**: A named, reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.

**Immutable**: Objects whose state cannot be modified after creation (e.g., strings, tuples, numbers).

**Index**: A position within an ordered sequence like a string or list, starting at 0.

**Input/Output (I/O)**: The communication between a program and the outside world, user, or another program.

**Integer**: A data type representing whole numbers.

**Iteration**: Executing a set of statements repeatedly, typically with loops.

**List**: An ordered, mutable collection of elements in Python, represented with square brackets `[]`.

**Loop**: A programming construct that repeats a section of code multiple times (for, while).

**Method**: A function that belongs to an object or class.

**Mutable**: Objects whose state can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

**Operator**: A symbol that performs operations on operands (e.g., +, -, *, /).

**Parameter**: A variable in a function definition that accepts values passed as arguments.

**PEP 8**: The style guide for Python code that provides coding conventions.

**Pseudocode**: A high-level description of an algorithm using human-readable terms.

**REPL**: Read-Evaluate-Print Loop, an interactive programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result.

**Return Value**: The value that a function sends back to the calling code.

**Scope**: The region in a program where a variable is recognized and can be referenced.

**Sequence**: An ordered collection of items, like strings, lists, and tuples.

**String**: A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

**Syntax**: The set of rules that defines how Python programs must be written to be valid.

**Tuple**: An ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python, represented with parentheses `()`.

**Variable**: A named storage location for data in a program.
