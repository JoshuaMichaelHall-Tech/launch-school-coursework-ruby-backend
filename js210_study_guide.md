# JS210: Fundamentals of JavaScript for Programmers - Study Guide

## JavaScript Basics

### Key Concepts:

1. **JavaScript Versions and History**
   - ECMAScript versions and their features
   - Browser compatibility considerations
   - Modern JavaScript (ES6+) vs. legacy JavaScript

2. **Data Types and Variables**
   - Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
   - Reference types: objects, arrays, functions
   - Variable declarations: `var`, `let`, `const`
   - Temporal dead zone and variable hoisting

3. **Operators and Expressions**
   - Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
   - Operator precedence and associativity
   - Expressions vs. statements
   - Type coercion in expressions

4. **Control Flow**
   - Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for...in`, `for...of`
   - Jump statements: `break`, `continue`
   - Exception handling: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`

### Practice Questions:

1. What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
2. How does type coercion work in JavaScript? Provide examples.
3. Explain hoisting and how it affects variable and function declarations.
4. What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript? List all the falsy values.
5. Demonstrate different ways to iterate through an array.

## Functions and Variable Scope

### Key Concepts:

1. **Function Definitions**
   - Function declarations vs. function expressions
   - Arrow functions and their unique characteristics
   - Higher-order functions
   - Function parameters and arguments

2. **Function Scope and Lexical Scoping**
   - Global scope vs. function scope vs. block scope
   - Lexical (static) scoping rules
   - Closure creation and usage
   - The `this` keyword in different contexts

3. **Function Invocation and Execution**
   - Regular function calls
   - Method calls
   - Constructor calls with `new`
   - Indirect calls with `call`, `apply`, and `bind`

4. **Hoisting in Functions**
   - Function declaration hoisting
   - Function expression hoisting behavior
   - Variables within functions

### Practice Questions:

1. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
2. Explain how closures work in JavaScript with an example.
3. How does the `this` keyword behave in different contexts?
4. Demonstrate the use of higher-order functions in JavaScript.
5. Explain the concept of lexical scoping with an example.

## Arrays and Objects

### Key Concepts:

1. **Array Fundamentals**
   - Creating and accessing arrays
   - Array methods: mutating vs. non-mutating
   - Array iteration methods
   - Multi-dimensional arrays

2. **Array Operations**
   - Adding and removing elements
   - Searching and filtering arrays
   - Transforming arrays
   - Combining arrays

3. **Object Basics**
   - Object literals and properties
   - Property access: dot notation vs. bracket notation
   - Object methods and the `this` binding
   - Object property attributes and descriptors

4. **Working with Objects**
   - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting properties
   - Object iteration methods
   - Shallow copying vs. deep copying
   - Object destructuring

### Practice Questions:

1. What are the differences between mutating and non-mutating array methods? Provide examples.
2. How would you shallow copy an array? How about a deep copy?
3. Explain the differences between dot notation and bracket notation for accessing object properties.
4. How can you iterate over all properties of an object?
5. What's the difference between `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`?

## Writing Better Code

### Key Concepts:

1. **JavaScript Style Guide**
   - Naming conventions
   - Formatting and indentation
   - Comments and documentation
   - File and project organization

2. **Code Quality**
   - Pure functions vs. functions with side effects
   - Avoiding global variables
   - Error handling best practices
   - Performance considerations

3. **Debugging Techniques**
   - Using the browser developer tools
   - Common error types and debugging patterns
   - Logging and debugging statements
   - Testing strategies

4. **JavaScript Best Practices**
   - Avoiding implicit type coercion
   - Using strict mode
   - Function composition and reusability
   - Code readability and maintainability

### Practice Questions:

1. What benefits does "use strict" mode provide? When would you use it?
2. How would you debug a JavaScript program in the browser?
3. What makes a function "pure"? Why are pure functions beneficial?
4. Describe some common JavaScript code smells and how to fix them.
5. What strategies can you use to make your JavaScript code more maintainable?
