# TS240: Introduction to TypeScript

## Overview
This course introduces TypeScript as a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript, focusing on its benefits for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. It builds on JavaScript knowledge to provide a comprehensive foundation in TypeScript development.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental features and benefits of TypeScript
- Master TypeScript's type system including primitives, complex, and generic types
- Learn mental models behind structural typing and type narrowing
- Add type safety to common JavaScript development patterns
- Develop scalable and maintainable applications using TypeScript best practices

## Key Concepts
- **TypeScript Fundamentals**: Syntax, configuration, compilation
- **Type System**: Basic and advanced type annotations
- **Type Inference**: Understanding how TypeScript infers types
- **Interfaces and Types**: Defining custom types and interfaces
- **Generics**: Creating reusable, type-safe components
- **Type Narrowing**: Techniques for narrowing types in code
- **Structural Typing**: Understanding TypeScript's type compatibility
- **Type Declarations**: Working with declaration files
- **Integration**: Using TypeScript with existing JavaScript

## Major Projects
1. **Type-Safe Library Implementation**
   - Purpose: Apply TypeScript to create reusable components
   - Implementation: Generic utility functions with complete type safety
   - Key Takeaways: Advanced type system features

2. **JavaScript to TypeScript Migration**
   - Purpose: Learn to convert existing code to TypeScript
   - Implementation: Refactoring JavaScript applications
   - Key Takeaways: Incremental adoption strategies

3. **TypeScript Application Development**
