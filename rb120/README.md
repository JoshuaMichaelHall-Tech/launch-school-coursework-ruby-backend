# RB120: Object Oriented Programming

## Overview
This course explores object-oriented programming concepts at the heart of Ruby. It covers fundamental OOP principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism while building several non-trivial OO programs.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand classes, objects, and their relationships in Ruby
- Master class inheritance and method lookup in Ruby
- Differentiate between instance and class methods/variables
- Work effectively with collaborator objects
- Design and implement OO programs
- Debug object-oriented code effectively

## Key Concepts
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and using custom types
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details and exposing interfaces
- **Inheritance**: Leveraging parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism**: Creating flexible interfaces through inheritance and modules
- **Method Lookup Path**: Understanding how Ruby finds methods
- **Collaborator Objects**: Working with objects that collaborate together
- **Modules**: Using mixins for shared behavior

## Major Assignments
1. **OO Rock Paper Scissors**
   - Purpose: Refactor procedural code into OO design
   - Implementation: Class hierarchy with game logic
   - Key Takeaways: Object design and relationship management

2. **OO Twenty-One**
   - Purpose: Implement a card game using OOP principles
   - Implementation: Classes for cards, deck, player, dealer, and game
   - Key Takeaways: Designing relationships between collaborating objects

3. **OO Tic Tac Toe**
   - Purpose: Develop a complex game using OOP
   - Implementation: Board, player, and game classes with AI logic
   - Key Takeaways: Managing state across multiple objects

4. **CRC Card Design**
   - Purpose: Learn design planning for OO systems
   - Implementation: Creating CRC cards for system components
   - Key Takeaways: Methodical approach to designing object-oriented systems

## Challenges Encountered
- Understanding the conceptual shift from procedural to object-oriented thinking
- Designing appropriate class hierarchies
- Managing the complexity of collaborator relationships
- Debugging issues in multi-object systems
- Determining appropriate levels of encapsulation

## Personal Notes
RB120 represented a significant paradigm shift in my programming journey. The transition from procedural thinking to object-oriented design required a different mental model but ultimately provided powerful tools for tackling complex problems. The concept of objects as self-contained entities with responsibilities transformed how I approach program design.
