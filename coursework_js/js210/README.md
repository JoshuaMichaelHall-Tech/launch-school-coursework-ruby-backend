# JS210: Fundamentals of JavaScript for Programmers

## Overview
This course serves as an introduction to JavaScript for those who have already programmed in another language. Since prior programming experience is assumed, the focus is on JavaScript-specific features, syntax, and idioms rather than general programming concepts.

## Learning Objectives
- Master JavaScript grammar, syntax, and data types
- Understand functions and higher-order functions in JavaScript
- Work effectively with arrays and objects as data structures
- Use JavaScript's built-in methods appropriately
- Write idiomatic and stylistic JavaScript code

## Key Concepts
- **JavaScript Basics**: Data types, variables, operators, expressions
- **Functions**: Function declarations, expressions, invocations, and arguments
- **Variable Scope**: Function scopes, lexical scoping, hoisting
- **Collections**: Arrays and their methods, objects and their properties
- **String Manipulation**: Working with strings efficiently
- **Logical Thinking**: Building procedural solutions in JavaScript

## Major Assignments
1. **JavaScript Exercises**
   - Purpose: Build comfort with JavaScript syntax and idioms
