# JS225: Object Oriented JavaScript

## Overview
This course dives into object-oriented programming in JavaScript, introducing various object creation patterns and exploring JavaScript's unique approach to OOP. It also examines JavaScript's execution context, closures, and function objects in depth.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model
- Master various object creation patterns in JavaScript
- Work effectively with execution contexts and the `this` keyword
- Leverage closures for encapsulation and information hiding
- Implement object-oriented designs in JavaScript

## Key Concepts
- **Objects**: Creating, accessing, and manipulating JavaScript objects
- **Prototypes**: Understanding JavaScript's prototype chain
- **Execution Context**: How `this` is determined in different situations
- **Closures**: Leveraging closures for information hiding and private data
- **Object Creation Patterns**: Factory functions, constructor functions, OLOO pattern
- **Function Execution**: Implicit vs. explicit function execution contexts

## Major Assignments
1. **Object Practice Problems**
   - Purpose: Build comfort with JavaScript's object model
   - Implementation: Problems focused on object creation and manipulation
   - Key Takeaways: JavaScript object fundamentals

2. **Function Context Problems**
   - Purpose: Master JavaScript's `this` binding rules
   - Implementation: Exercises on function contexts and binding
   - Key Takeaways: Understanding and controlling execution context

3. **Object Creation Pattern Projects**
   - Purpose: Implement different object creation approaches
   - Implementation: Building the same system using different patterns
   - Key Takeaways: Relative strengths of different object creation patterns

4. **Banking Project**
   - Purpose: Apply closures and objects to build a practical system
   - Implementation: A banking system with private data
   - Key Takeaways: Encapsulation and information hiding in JavaScript

## Challenges Encountered
- Grasping JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model
- Understanding execution context and `this` binding rules
- Managing context loss in different situations
- Choosing appropriate object creation patterns
- Implementing encapsulation without traditional class-based features
