# JS230: DOM and Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript

## Overview
This course focuses on front-end web development using JavaScript, teaching how to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and make asynchronous HTTP requests. It bridges the gap between JavaScript programming and interactive web applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the Document Object Model (DOM) and its API
- Master event-driven and asynchronous programming
- Make HTTP requests from JavaScript applications
- Build interactive web applications
- Work with third-party libraries like jQuery
- Apply JavaScript to real-world frontend development challenges

## Key Concepts
- **DOM**: Document structure, traversal, manipulation
- **Events**: Event handling, propagation, delegation
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Callbacks, promises, async/await
- **HTTP Requests**: XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API
- **jQuery**: DOM manipulation, event handling, AJAX
- **Templates**: Dynamic HTML content generation
- **Application Architecture**: Organizing frontend code
