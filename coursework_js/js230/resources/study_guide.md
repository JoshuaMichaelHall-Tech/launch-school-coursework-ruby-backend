   - Dynamic content rendering

3. **Library Integration**
   - Loading and initializing libraries
   - Managing library dependencies
   - Memory management with libraries
   - Library conflicts and resolutions
   - Modular approach to library usage

4. **Reading Documentation**
   - Understanding library APIs
   - Finding appropriate methods
   - Interpreting parameters and return values
   - Using examples and demos
   - Troubleshooting with documentation

### Practice Questions:

1. Compare jQuery's approach to DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.
2. How would you create a reusable template with Handlebars?
3. Write a function that uses jQuery to perform an AJAX request.
