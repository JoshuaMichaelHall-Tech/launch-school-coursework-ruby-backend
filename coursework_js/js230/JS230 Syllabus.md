# DOM and Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript

## Summary

In this course, we'll begin to draw from what we’ve mastered in the HTML/CSS course and the JavaScript courses and learn how to add behavior to our user interfaces with JavaScript. We’ll start by learning about the DOM and how it lets developers change a document. In the lessons that follow, we’ll see how to update the interface in response to actions triggered by the user or the browser. We’ll also explore `XMLHttpRequest`, one of the browser APIs that provide network programming functionality to JavaScript applications. We'll also learn about asynchronous JavaScript, as well as how we can leverage third party libraries, such as jQuery to simplify certain aspects of front-end development. Finally, we'll pull all of those topics together to work on a number of projects.
