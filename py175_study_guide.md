# PY175: Networked Applications with Python - Study Guide

## 1. HTTP and Web Fundamentals

### Understanding HTTP
- **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web
- **HTTP** is a stateless, request-response protocol
- **HTTP** messages consist of headers and an optional body
- **HTTP** methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **HTTP** status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)
- **HTTP** is inherently insecure; **HTTPS** adds encryption via TLS

### Request/Response Cycle
- Client sends a request to a server
- Server processes the request
- Server returns a response to the client
- A single request/response cycle is independent of others

### URL Structure
- **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) identifies resources on the web
- URL components: scheme, host, port, path, query string, fragment
- Example: `https://example.com:443/path/to/resource?query=value#section`
- URL encoding: mechanism for safely transmitting special characters

### State Management
- HTTP is inherently stateless (no memory between requests)
- Common techniques to simulate state:
  - Cookies: small data pieces stored in the browser
  - Sessions: server-side storage identified by a session ID
  - Query strings: parameters in the URL
  - Hidden form fields: data embedded in HTML forms
  - Local storage: client-side storage for web applications

## 2. WSGI and Web Frameworks

### WSGI Fundamentals
- **WSGI** (Web Server Gateway Interface) - standard interface between web servers and Python web applications
- Defines how web servers communicate with Python applications
- Key components: server, application, middleware
- Basic WSGI application is a callable that accepts `environ` and `start_response`

### Introduction to Flask
- Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework
- Based on Werkzeug (WSGI toolkit) and Jinja2 (template engine)
- Follows the microframework concept (minimal core, extensible with extensions)
- Key features:
  - Routing system
  - Template engine integration
  - Testing support
  - Easy extensibility

### Flask Application Structure
- Flask application instance
- Route definitions
- View functions
- Templates
- Static files
- Configuration
- Blueprints for modularity

### Flask Routes and URL Building
- Route decorators map URLs to view functions
- URL patterns and variable rules
- URL converters (string, int, float, path, etc.)
- `url_for()` function for URL generation
- Redirects and error handlers

## 3. Templates and Rendering

### Jinja2 Template Engine
- Syntax and basic usage
- Variables and expressions
- Control structures:
  - Conditionals: `{% if %}`, `{% elif %}`, `{% else %}`
  - Loops: `{% for %}`, `{% endfor %}`
- Template inheritance:
  - Base templates: `{% block %}`
  - Child templates: `{% extends %}`, `{% block %}`
- Template inclusion:
  - `{% include %}` for partial templates

### Template Organization
- Template inheritance patterns
- Layout templates vs. content templates
- Reusable template parts (partials)
- Using macros for reusable template fragments

### Static Files
- Serving static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
- Organization of static files
- URL generation for static files with `url_for('static', filename='...')`
- Caching considerations

### Template Filters
- Built-in filters for data transformation
- Custom filter creation and registration
- Common filters:
  - `safe`, `escape`
  - `capitalize`, `upper`, `lower`
  - `date`, `time`
  - `truncate`, `wordcount`

## 4. Forms and Validation
