# RB175: Networked Applications

## Overview
This course covers server-side web development fundamentals, focusing on HTTP and the request/response cycle. It begins with networking principles before exploring how to build dynamic web applications from scratch using Ruby and the Sinatra framework.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand HTTP and the request/response cycle in depth
- Master the basics of server-side web development
- Build dynamic web applications from first principles
- Learn to use the Sinatra framework for web development
- Implement security best practices in web applications
- Deploy applications to production environments

## Key Concepts
- **HTTP Protocol**: Methods, headers, status codes, and request/response cycle
- **Web Architecture**: Understanding clients, servers, and internet infrastructure
- **Sinatra Framework**: Building lightweight web applications
- **Templating**: Using ERB for dynamic HTML generation
- **Sessions and Cookies**: Managing state in web applications
- **Web Security**: Common vulnerabilities and protections
- **Deployment**: Pushing applications to production environments

## Major Assignments
1. **Book Reading Application**
   - Purpose: Build a simple web application for reading text files
   - Implementation: Sinatra app with file-based storage
   - Key Takeaways: Routes, templates, and basic web application structure

2. **Todo List Application**
   - Purpose: Create a CRUD web application with persistent storage
   - Implementation: Sinatra app with session management and data validation
   - Key Takeaways: State management, forms, and user input handling

3. **File-Based CMS**
   - Purpose: Develop a content management system
   - Implementation: Sinatra app with file operations and user authentication
   - Key Takeaways: User authentication, security practices, and session management

## Challenges Encountered
- Understanding the stateless nature of HTTP
- Managing application state with sessions and cookies
- Implementing proper security measures for web applications
- Debugging issues in the request/response cycle

## Personal Notes
RB175 bridged the gap between Ruby programming and web development. Understanding HTTP's fundamental role in web applications provided crucial context for modern web development. Building applications from scratch without heavy frameworks helped me understand what happens "under the hood" in larger web frameworks.
